In the third week of Tuwaiq camp 1000 , I was able to initially program the first application , the name of the application, “Your Help on the Way” , which is a user for requesting and admin to receive requests and take the necessary action. Outside the city, to send a helicopter if it is outside the city or an ambulance if it is inside the city, after determining the location, the application requests the person’s data such as the name, phone number, location of the case and also determines the type of injury, using several software functions,
